# EmoRec: Semantic Movie Recommender Using Emotion Knowledge Graphs

## Project Overview

Instead of collaborative filtering or content-based ML, we use **rule-based reasoning over a knowledge graph** to:
- Represent movies and emotions semantically
- Infer recommendations using **forward/backward chaining**
- Explain **why** a movie was recommended

---

**Key Ideas Used**:
- Extracting emotions from users and mapping them to movies
- Knowledge graph for emotional reasoning
- Bias-aware recommendations
